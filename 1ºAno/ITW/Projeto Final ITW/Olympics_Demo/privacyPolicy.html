            <p>This Privacy Policy, as updated from time to time, explains how the International Olympic Committee (“<strong>IOC</strong>”) processes personal data in the context of its digital activities. For example, websites, mobile applications, connected TV applications, registration systems, digital marketing, online professional services and business resources, as well as engagement and information services that are each managed by the IOC alone or in cooperation with other members of the Olympic Movement. We refer to these activities as the “<strong>Services</strong>” in this Privacy Policy.&nbsp;</p>
            
            <p>It also details how the IOC processes personal data that it receives from other organisations, or via cookies and similar technologies that are integrated into another organisation’s digital properties for the benefit of the IOC.&nbsp;</p>
            
            <p>Other organisations may launch and operate websites, newsletters, e-commerce platforms or other services that are (a) related to the Olympic Games, Youth Olympic Games or to the Olympic Movement’s activities, or (b) feature Olympics-related content. Such sites and services are operated independently from the IOC and are not covered by this Privacy Policy. We therefore encourage you to read the terms of use and privacy policies that are applicable to those sites and services. If we collect or otherwise receive personal data through them, this will be indicated in the site’s or service owner’s privacy policies and/or terms of use.</p>
            <h3>PRIVACY POLICY UPDATE: This Privacy Policy was last updated on 20 July 2022. The update has been made to reflect the following material changes:</h3>
            
            <ul>
            <li>In order to provide you with the best Olympics experience, we have made changes to the account sign up and login process. If you open an account via services offered by the Paris 2024 Organising Committee for the Olympic and Paralympic Games (otherwise referred to as “Paris 2024”) you will be able to create and access your Olympic ID account using the same credentials. And, if you have an Olympic ID but would like to create and access your account on services offered by Paris 2024, you can do so using your Olympic ID credentials. As a result, both Paris 2024 and the IOC have access to, and are responsible for protecting, the personal data you provide for the purpose of identity and access management. You can contact the IOC through the <a href="https://privacyportal-eu.onetrust.com/webform/22395098-025a-4a86-b716-763ae9c9a4cf/787ca7a8-5c45-45f9-9c4d-29ef9d88bb1d" target="_blank">IOC’s dedicated portal</a> to exercise your data protection rights. See Annex 3 of this Privacy Policy for more information. You can also contact Paris 2024 directly through <a href="mailto:dpo@paris2024.org" target="_blank">dpo@paris2024.org</a> to make requests about the account that you created via services offered by Paris 2024.</li>
            <li>This Privacy Policy has also been updated to state that the IOC will share your personal data with Paris 2024 where you have consented to receive marketing communications from Paris 2024.</li>
            <li>In addition, if you have created an account on services offered by Paris 2024, we may share with Paris 2024 the data we collect about you when you engage with our Services. We share such data with Paris 2024 on the basis of Paris 2024’s legitimate interest to better understand its fans and personalise its services, products and communications.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Who are we?</h3>
            
            <p>When we refer to ‘<strong>’we’’</strong>, ‘<strong>’our’’</strong> or “<strong>us</strong>” in this Privacy Policy, we mean the IOC. We also mean the Olympic Foundation for Culture and Heritage (the “<strong>Foundation</strong>”) and the Organising Committees for the Olympic and Paralympic Games (the “<strong>OCOGs</strong>”) where the IOC processes data jointly with them. Annexes 2 and 3, as updated from time to time, provide further details on where this is the case.&nbsp;</p>
            
            <p>The IOC is a private, not-for-profit, international organisation recognised to be of public interest by the Swiss authorities and constituted in the form of a Swiss law association, having its registered office in Maison Olympique (Olympic House) 1007 Lausanne, Switzerland. The mission of the IOC is to promote Olympism throughout the world, to lead the Olympic Movement and to ensure the regular celebration of the Olympic Games. To learn more about the IOC, its goals and activities, please consult the <a href="https://stillmed.olympics.com/media/Document Library/OlympicOrg/General/EN-Olympic-Charter.pdf" target="_blank">Olympic Charter</a>and the <a href="https://olympics.com/ioc/principles" target="_blank">IOC Principles</a>.&nbsp;</p>
            
            <p>The Foundation manages the Olympic Museum and the Olympic Studies Centre in Lausanne, Switzerland.&nbsp;</p>
            
            <p>An OCOG is responsible for organising an edition of the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games. Each OCOG is based in the territory in which its respective Olympic and Paralympic Games shall be hosted.&nbsp;</p>
            
            <p>When we refer to “<strong>you</strong>” or “<strong>your</strong>” we mean those individuals whose data we collect through the Services, or whose data we receive from other organisations that we work with.</p>
            <h3>Our role in the processing of personal data</h3>
            
            <p><strong>1- Data collected via the Services</strong></p>
            
            <p>The IOC is the data controller of data that is collected through the Services <strong>except</strong>:&nbsp;</p>
            
            <ul>
            <li><p>where the privacy information (which includes information about cookies) provided in relation to the Services states otherwise; &nbsp;  </p></li>
            <li><p>where the Services relate to the Olympic Museum (in particular <a href="https://olympics.com/museum" target="_blank">https://olympics.com/museum</a>, <a href="https://museumshop.olympics.com/" target="_blank">https://museumshop.olympics.com</a>), the Olympic Studies Centre (in particular <a href="https://olympics.com/ioc/olympic-studies-centre" target="_blank">https://olympics.com/ioc/olympic-studies-centre</a>, <a href="https://library.olympics.com/" target="_blank">https://library.olympics.com/</a>) and other activities of the Foundation. In which case, your personal data will be processed by the IOC and the Foundation for the purposes detailed in Annex 2, acting as joint controllers; or&nbsp;  </p></li>
            <li><p>where the IOC is engaged in digital activities with other organisations within the Olympic Movement, such as OCOGs. In which case, Annex 3 of this Privacy Policy (or the privacy information presented at the point of data collection) details each organisation’s controllership of the data involved.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><strong>2- Data collected via third-party sites and services</strong></p>
            
            <p>Where the IOC receives information that has been collected by other organisations, the IOC is a data controller of the data it receives. This applies to personal data that is collected via websites and other digital services owned or operated by:&nbsp;</p>
            
            <ul>
            <li>OCOGs, and&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
            <li>other commercial organisations that are permitted to sell and promote Olympic-themed digital services or to use the Olympic Properties.&nbsp;</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>See paragraph 3 “<strong>Collection of data through third parties</strong>” in the section “<strong>What information do we collect?</strong>” (below) as well as Annex 3 for more details.</p>
            <h2>What information do we collect?</h2>
            
            <h3>1. Information that you provide to us</h3>
            
            <p>You provide us with information, including personal data, when you use the Services.&nbsp; In particular, when you register for the Services and create a user account, communicate with us, request,use or otherwise interact with a service or other initiative that we provide, complete certain transactions or subscribe to B2B Services or B2C Services, promotional communications or media alerts. “<strong>B2B Services</strong>” means those Services that are online professional services and business resources. “<strong>B2C Services</strong>” means Services that are engagement and information services.&nbsp;</p>
            
            <p><strong>a) Registration data</strong></p>
            
            <p>Our content is generally available via the Services without registration. However, certain professional services, business resources and event registration services as well as certain personalisation options, transactions, functionalities or activities (e.g. games, contests, sweepstakes, newsletters, and e-commerce,…) that are offered through the Services may require that you register with us and provide certain information about yourself. &nbsp;</p>
            
            <p>Registration is governed by the terms of service at <a href="https://olympics.com/en/terms-of-service" target="_blank">https://olympics.com/en/terms-of-service</a> as well as any additional terms that are presented when you interact with the Services (together these terms are referred to in this Privacy Policy as the “<strong>Terms of Service</strong>”).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
            
            <p>If you create a user account, you will be asked to provide personal data such as your email address, place of residence, age information, and password. You may be able to use this account for all Services, although user accounts for B2B Services are different to those accounts created for B2C Services. Certain Services, like Athlete 365 (<a href="https://olympics.com/athlete365/" target="_blank">https://olympics.com/athlete365/</a>), are focused on athletes and we may ask you to provide information about the sports you practice, your team or your participation in the Olympic Games or Youth Olympic Games.&nbsp;</p>
            
            <p><strong>b) Data necessary to provide you certain Services</strong></p>
            
            <p>Certain Services require that you provide information about yourself. This is the case, for instance, in respect of:&nbsp;</p>
            
            <ul>
            <li>the B2B Services that we make available to other Olympic Movement stakeholders, or&nbsp;</li>
            <li>the Services that enable you to register for or apply for accreditation to the Olympic Games, Youth Olympic Games or other events organised by us, as well as the Services through which you may book travel and accommodation related to these events.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>You may also need to provide your information&nbsp; in order to use the Services through which you can procure goods or services from us or participate in any game, contest, sweepstake or other fan engagement opportunity.&nbsp;</p>
            
            <p>In these different situations and where necessary we will inform you more specifically about the information we need to collect in order to provide you with the requested goods or services and of any other conditions applicable to the processing of this personal data. The information needed will vary depending on the nature of the Services. It may include information such as: first name, last name, business organisation, job title, physical address, phone number, nationality, travel and accommodation details, passport or ID card number, credit card information, height and weight information, size of garments or shoes, allergies and food habits.&nbsp;</p>
            
            <p><strong>c) Communications data</strong></p>
            
            <p>If you communicate with us and/or request any information or service from us, we will use your account information and any other information you may provide us with (such as email address, phone number, and the content of your communication or request) in order to respond to you.</p>
            <h3>2. Information that is collected through cookies and similar technologies</h3>
            
            <p>We use automatic tracking mechanisms like cookies and similar technologies to collect certain data while you are browsing our Services, or when you visit the sites or services of other organisations that we work with. A cookie is a small file, stored on your browser or computer hard drive, which is used to collect data about your interactions with websites and other digital properties. For example, information about your device (browser type, operating system, language, unique device identifier), network connections (Internet Service Provider, IP address, time zone), browsing history including date and time and pages visited, as well as general location such as your city and country.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
            
            <p>You can disable cookies (except those cookies that are strictly necessary) or manage cookies using the cookies settings available on each of the websites or other digital properties through which the cookies are set. You can also manage cookies by configuring the functionalities of your internet browser.&nbsp;</p>
            
            <p>To know more about our use of cookies on the Services, and how to manage your consent to cookies, please consult our Cookie Policy at <a href="https://olympics.com/en/cookie-policy" target="_blank">https://olympics.com/en/cookie-policy</a>. Where our cookies are placed on third-party sites or services, you should consult their cookie policies and consent management tools.</p>
            <h3>3. Collection of data through third parties</h3>
            
            <p>You can register with us by using the information of an account you hold with a third party such as Facebook, Google, Twitter and Apple. If you choose this option, you authorise these organisations to provide us with some of the personal data they hold about you so that we can use it to create your user account with us. The personal data shared with us will depend on the third-party services that you use to register with us and on the scope of the information you allow those third parties to share, but typically it includes your first name and last name, user name, phone number, unique identifiers and access tokens, e-mail address, date of birth and preferences (e.g. pages you have favourited or saved).&nbsp;</p>
            
            <p>In some scenarios we authorise third parties to launch and operate Olympic-themed digital services or to feature Olympic Properties within their websites or other digital services. For example, the Olympic Shop operated by Fanatics, Inc. and its affiliates under authorisation of the IOC and OCOGs (see, for instance, the EU version of the Olympic Shop here <a href="https://shop.olympics.com/en/" target="_blank">https://shop.olympics.com/en/</a>).&nbsp; These third parties may share information that they collect about you with us, for example your first and last name or unique identifier, your email address, your stated marketing preferences and data about the webpages you visit and the Olympic-branded products that you purchase. In such cases, the sharing of information with us will be specified in, and carried out in accordance with, the privacy and cookie policies issued by these third parties.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
            
            <p>OCOGs, in particular Paris 2024 and the Milano Cortina Organising Committee of Olympic and Paralympic Games, share the personal data of their users with the IOC. In such cases, their sharing of personal data with the IOC will be specified in, and carried out in accordance with, the privacy and cookie policies issued by each of the relevant OCOGs.</p>
            <h3>4. Information manifestly made public</h3>
            
            <p>Content offered on our Services may include information manifestly made public such as competitions and results, biographies about Olympians and other athletes, coaches and other persons involved in the Olympic Games, Youth Olympic Games and other major sports competitions, who are newsworthy and whose stories contribute to the mission of the IOC and the Olympic Movement. This information was disclosed by athletes and other concerned persons in the context of their participation in Olympic Games, Youth Olympic Games and other sports competitions, interviews and other media events, media publications or through other means and was compiled by us, in cooperation with International Federations, National Olympic Committees, Organising Committees for the Olympic Games and Youth Olympic Games and other Olympic Movement stakeholders.</p>
            <h2>How do we use the information we collect?</h2>
            
            <p>We use the information we collect about you and your use of the Services and, where relevant, your use of third party sites and services, to:&nbsp;</p>
            
            <p>a) facilitate your use of the Services, enable your registration and authentication, and manage your user account;&nbsp;</p>
            
            <p>b) maintain and develop the Services;&nbsp;</p>
            
            <p>c) gather statistics to help diagnose problems, enhance your experience of the Services and improve the quality of the Services;&nbsp;</p>
            
            <p>d) ensure the security of the Services and make sure that the Services are used in compliance with our Terms of Service and applicable laws;&nbsp;</p>
            
            <p>e) carry out fan and audience analysis and to offer a personalised experience.

This includes personal data collected through the Services (for example, where you subscribe to receive promotional communications from OCOGs) or by other organisations that we work with.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
            
            <p>Annex 3 of this Privacy Policy provides more information about these OCOGs, the situations in which we share personal data with them and the purposes for which they may use such data.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            <p>We rely on a network of professional service providers who are working on our behalf and help us to operate, develop, secure, promote and measure the Services and our advertisements. The services provided by these organisations include, in particular:&nbsp;</p>
            
            <p>a) customer data infrastructure, platform development services and general IT services;&nbsp;</p>

            <p>h) services to manage user access requests and cookie consents.&nbsp;</p>
            
            <p>In order to deliver these services to us,&nbsp; these organisations will process your personal data. These service providers are bound by strict confidentiality obligations. The service providers will retain and use such personal data for as long as they are working for us or until you decide to delete your account or unsubscribe from the Services. A list of our main service providers (including, for each service provider, their contact information) is provided in Annex 1 of this Privacy Policy.&nbsp;</p>
            
            <p>In some cases, the organisations we work with may act as data controllers of your personal data. For example, third parties that assist us with the serving of advertisements, and those third parties authorised to launch and operate Olympic-themed digital services or to use our brands. These third parties are typically governed by their own terms of service and privacy policies, which we strongly recommend you read.&nbsp;</p>
            
            <h3>4. Events-related services, contests, sweepstakes and other services</h3>
            
            <p>Our Services can be used to register for and participate in games, contests, sweepstakes or other fan engagement opportunities, or to apply for registration or accreditation to attend the Olympic Games or other events organised by us, or for booking travel and accommodation in relation to these events and services.&nbsp;</p>
            
            <p>In certain situations, the provision of the services requested by you may require us to share your personal data with third parties (e.g. CarlsonWagonlits Travel and other travel or accommodation providers, organising committees, or governmental agencies,…). We may also share your information with third parties when some of the Services such as games, contests, sweepstakes or other fan engagement opportunities are available on third-party sites and services or where we engage a third party to assist us with prize fulfilment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
            
            <p>Other services that you request from us may also require that we share your information with third parties assisting us with the delivery of such services, such as Olympic Movement entities (International Federations, National Olympic Committees or OCOGs…), academic institutions, or other delivery partners. We will specify in the Terms of Service or other user-facing information the categories of third parties with whom your personal data may have to be shared and other conditions applicable to such sharing of information.&nbsp;</p>
            
            <h3>5. Offers and services from our partners</h3>
            
            <p>From time to time, we will offer you the possibility to receive services and communications (including communications related to products and services) from selected third parties, such as our commercial partners and other constituents of the Olympic Movement. In case you opt-in to such services or communications (or can otherwise lawfully receive communications from them), we will share your personal data with these organisations.&nbsp;</p>
            
            <p>Upon your consent, we transfer your e-mail address to the International Paralympic Committee (“<strong>IPC</strong>”) for the purpose of promotional communications about the Paralympic Games, the Paralympic Movement and the related initiatives of IPC partners. The IPC will process your personal data as a separate data controller where you decide to subscribe to the IPC’s promotional communications. Should you wish to opt-out of the IPC’s promotional communications, please contact the IPC directly.&nbsp;</p>
            
            <h3>6. Legal disclosure</h3>
            
            <p>We reserve the right to disclose personal data we hold about you if we are required to do so under applicable laws or pursuant to any judicial or administrative process and, to the extent necessary, to investigate, prevent, or take actions in relation to unlawful activities or violation of our Terms of Service.</p>
            <h2>How do we protect your personal information?</h2>
            
            <h3>1. Data security</h3>
            
            <p>We use technical and organisational measures to protect your personal data against the risks of damage, destruction, loss or unauthorised access, in accordance with applicable laws.&nbsp;</p>
            
            <h3>2. International transfer</h3>
            
            <p>We may process your personal data in a territory other than your place of residence. We adopt measures as required under applicable law to ensure your data will be given the relevant protection.&nbsp;</p>
            
            <p>The personal data we collect will usually be processed in the European Union or in Switzerland (which provides a level of protection equivalent to the European Economic Area according to the European Commission Decision of 26 July 2000). We may, however, transfer your personal data to third parties for the purposes and legal basis for processing highlighted in this Privacy Policy (see the section above ‘<strong>Who do we share your information with?’</strong>). Some of these third parties may be based in countries that, like the United States of America, do not provide in their laws for a level of protection of your privacy equivalent to that applied within the European Union and Switzerland. We adopt measures as required under applicable law to ensure your data will be given the relevant protection.  Before transferring data from Switzerland or the European Union to other countries, we implement safeguard mechanisms recognised by Swiss and European regulators, in particular standard contractual clauses.&nbsp;</p>
            
            <h3>3. Age limitation</h3>
            
            <p>We will not knowingly collect personal data about users under 13 years old. Unless the Terms of Services state otherwise, the Services are intended for users who are of legal age for data protection purposes according to the laws of the territory in which they reside. You can learn more about our age requirements here:  <a href="https://olympics.com/en/age-consent" target="_blank">https://olympics.com/en/age-consent</a> . If we become aware that a child below age has provided us with personal data, we will take steps to delete their personal data and close their account. If you become aware that your child has provided us with personal data without your consent, please contact us.</p>
            
            <h3>4. Data retention</h3>
            
            <p>We will retain your personal data only for the duration necessary for the purposes identified in this Privacy Policy or as required to meet our legal requirements.&nbsp;</p>
            
            <p>Where your personal data has been collected through a section of the Olympics.com website or associated mobile application dedicated to a specific edition of the Games, and where necessary to achieve its long-term mission to promote Olympic Movement and preserve the legacy of the Games and maintain user engagement, the IOC may continue to process such personal data even after the relevant OCOG (such as the Tokyo Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games as established by the Tokyo Metropolitan Government and the Japanese Olympic Committee) has stopped its own processing of the data. The IOC will continue to process your personal data in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
            <h2>Legal basis for processing your personal information and your rights</h2>
            
            <p>We mainly process your information to perform our obligations under the Terms of Service but, in certain cases, we rely on an alternative legal basis. We have detailed below the legal bases on which we process your personal data.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
            
            <p>Please note, however, that we adapt our legal basis for processing if the laws of the jurisdiction where you reside require us to do so. In particular, in territories where we must rely on a legal basis other than what is detailed in this section, your acceptance of this  Privacy Policy constitutes your consent to the data processing activities described herein. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
            
            <h3>1. Contractual necessity</h3>

            <h2>ANNEX 2: Joint Control in Services</h2>
            
            <h3>THE FOUNDATION</h3>
            
            <p>When the Services relate to the Olympic Museum or the Olympic Studies Centre, the IOC and Foundation act as joint controllers for the purposes of facilitating your use of the Services, enabling your registration and authentication, and managing your user account, and providing you goods, services, information, or content that you have requested.&nbsp;</p>
            
            <p>For the Services that relate to the Olympic Museum or the Olympic Studies Centre, the data generated by cookies will be processed by the IOC and the Foundation, acting as joint controllers.</p>
            <h2>ANNEX 3: Activities involving the IOC and other organisations within the Olympic Movement</h2>
            
            <p>The IOC often works with other organisations within the Olympic Movement. In particular, the OCOGs that are each responsible for organising an edition of the Olympic Games or Youth Olympic Games, official marketing partners, rights-holding broadcasters, National Olympic Committees and international sports federations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
            
            <p>In the case of OCOGs, for example:&nbsp;</p>
            
            <ul>
            <li>the IOC may host the official website or manage the official app connected to an edition of the Olympic Games or Youth Olympic Games;&nbsp;</li>
            <li>the IOC may share certain of its IT resources (in particular, systems that support account creation and management) with an OCOG so that users can benefit from services that are jointly or independently provided by the IOC and OCOG; or&nbsp;</li>
            <li>the IOC and OCOGs may appoint the same third party to sell Olympic-related merchandise or services.&nbsp;</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Where these activities entail the processing of personal data, we will provide additional information about the roles and responsibilities of each of the organisations involved, as required by applicable laws. Such information will be provided in this Annex 3 (as updated from time to time) or, for short-term activities, provided at the point of data collection.</p>
            <h2>Activities taking place as at the date of this Privacy Policy</h2>
            
            <p><strong>1.Sharing of IT resources</strong></p>
            
            <p>To improve user experience, the IOC and Paris 2024 use common IT resources, in particular an identity and access management system. This system supports user account creation and management on the Services as well as on certain services offered by Paris 2024 via its <a href="http://www.Paris2024.org">www.Paris2024.org</a> website and other Paris 2024 digital platforms, including Club 2024, Terre de Jeux, and Génération 2024 (the “<strong>Paris 2024 Services</strong>”).</p>
            
            <p>Where you have created an account on the Paris 2024 Services, you will be able to create and access an Olympic ID account using the same credentials. And the same will apply where you have an Olympic ID account and subsequently create an account on the Paris 2024 Services. As a result, both Paris 2024 and the IOC will have access to (and will share between them), and are responsible for protecting, the personal data that you provide for the purpose of identity access and account management, in particular to avoid any account duplication and/or to ensure accuracy of the personal data related to a user account.</p>
            
            <p>The IOC and Paris 2024 are joint controllers with respect to the processing of data in connection with the account creation and management mentioned above. In its role as joint controller, the IOC is responsible for maintaining the common IT resources that are used for such account creation and management.</p>
            
            <p>The legal basis for the processing of personal data in connection with this activity is contractual necessity.</p>
            
            <p>If you wish to exercise your rights as a data subject in respect of the above, you may contact the IOC through the <a href="https://privacyportal-eu.onetrust.com/webform/22395098-025a-4a86-b716-763ae9c9a4cf/787ca7a8-5c45-45f9-9c4d-29ef9d88bb1d" target="_blank">IOC’s dedicated portal</a>. For other questions about your account on the Paris 2024 Services (for example, questions about the availability of the services and login errors), please contact Paris 2024 at the address <a href="mailto:dpo@paris2024.org">dpo@paris2024.org</a></p>
            
            <p><strong>2.IOC’s collection of a marketing communications opt-in</strong></p>
            
            <p>The Services may feature a means by which you can opt in to receive marketing communications from one or more OCOGs. If you choose to opt in, the IOC will share your personal data with the relevant OCOG(s).</p>
            
            <p>The OCOG(s) (each as an independent controller) use this data to send you marketing communications, including marketing related to their products, services and partners.</p>
            
            <p>As at the date of this Privacy Policy, the Services include an opt-in to the marketing communications of Paris 2024, including newsletters and other marketing related to their products, services and partners. Paris 2024’s privacy policy provides more information about how it uses personal data as well as the rights of data subjects, and can be found here: <strong><a href="https://www.paris2024.org/en/privacy-policy/">https://www.paris2024.org/en/privacy-policy/</a></strong></p>
            
            <p><strong>3.IOC’s onward transfer of data to OCOGs</strong></p>
            
            <p>The IOC and the Paris 2024 Organising Committee for the Olympic and Paralympic Games (“<strong>Paris 2024</strong>”) have authorised Fanatics, Inc. (“<strong>Fanatics</strong>”) to sell official Olympic-merchandise. In accordance with the Fanatics Olympic Shop privacy policy (see here: <a href="https://shop.olympics.com/en/ioc-fi-privacy-policy/ch-2994" target="_blank">https://shop.olympics.com/en/ioc-fi-privacy-policy/ch-2994</a>, although the version of the policy that Fanatics displays to you will be determined by your region), Fanatics shares the data of shop visitors with the IOC, which the IOC then shares with Paris 2024. In particular, the IOC shares the data of shop visitors who purchase a product which features Paris 2024 branding or is otherwise related to the Paris 2024 Olympic Games, visitors who reside in France, or visitors who have provided their consent to receive Paris 2024 marketing communications.</p>
            
            <p>In addition, if you have created an account on services offered by Paris 2024, we may share with Paris 2024 the data we collect about you when you engage with our Services.</p>
            
            <p>Paris 2024 (as an independent controller) uses this data to better understand its fans, personalise its services and products and communications, carry out behavioural analysis and to analyse traffic performance.</p>
            
            <p>The sharing of data described in this paragraph 3 with Paris 2024 is based on Paris 2024’s legitimate interest.</p>
            
            <p>Paris 2024’s privacy policy provides more information about how it uses personal data as well as the rights of data subjects, and can be found here: <strong><a href="https://www.paris2024.org/en/privacy-policy/">https://www.paris2024.org/en/privacy-policy/</a></strong></p>
