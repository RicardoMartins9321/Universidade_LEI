"""
The first function matcols(M) returns the number of columns in matrix M by taking the length of the first row of the matrix.

The second function matzeros(m, n) creates a matrix of zeroes with m rows and n columns.
It uses nested list comprehension to create the matrix.

The third function matmult(A, B) calculates the matrix product AB by creating an empty matrix with the same 
number of rows as A and the same number of columns as B. 
Then it uses 3 nested loops to iterate through each element of the resulting matrix and calculate 
the dot product of the corresponding row of matrix A and column of matrix B."""
